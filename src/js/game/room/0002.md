Directly to your left when entering the wash and waste room you will find your personal closet with several identical sets of your outfit.  Color doesn't matter to you - only utility since you can't actually tell the difference anyway.  Your wash and bed linens are also stored in this closet.

Just beyond the closet on the right is the waste facility.  This is where you relieve yourself as well as dispose of any unwanted materials.  Everything is recycled to be used again in something else.  It's something you'd rather not know the process of.

To the left is the wash facilities.  Here you bathe, wash your hands, clean your clothes and various other functions.
